# AWS-Lambda-PMParser
## The goal of the program is to allow for quick, abbreviated searches of keywords across programmatically accessible content on pubmed/pubmed central databases.

### Notice the Python 3.9 layer in the Python subdirectory. I included the layer only because it includes downloaded stopwords for the english language used by the NLP algorithm.

### This program is meant to work on AWS Lambda, you'll need to provide an email to receive notifications from NCBI with.
### Of course you should add your Lambda functions link to the action of the HTML forms.
